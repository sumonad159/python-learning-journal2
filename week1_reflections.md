So far we have worked on recursion which in theory I understand, but have difficulties when thinking of how to work it into code. For example, the lab we were working on this week was to get through a maze (array of 0s & 1s), but I didn't know where to start other than the function would probably need a lot of if statements and == 0 or == 1. Since mastering recursion is crucial, I think I need to plan things out for a problem more theoretically on paper, whether that's a uml diagram or some other way to break the problem down to the smallest possible base case more easily.
